The main application window is laid out in a way where everything important to the user is on the same screen. The 1st 2 centered rows display the current class and category presented to you on the screen. The bottom row contains buttons that deal with the functionality of managing your grades and the option to instantly launch this semester upon next launch via the quicklaunch utility.

The centered columns are where the information presented to you about your grades are displayed to you. The left column contains a table that displays your overall grade (or best and worst possible grades) and some statistical values used to calculate your grades for each class along with a text field for overall extra credit and grade penalties can be factored in for calculating your overall grade in a class and a combo box for switching classes. The right column contains a table that displays each graded assignment, exam, etc. that can be updated as many times as needed along with a combo box for switching categories for a particular class.

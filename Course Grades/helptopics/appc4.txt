If an overall grade for a class is not able to be computed yet, another feature is unlocked where you can calculate a distributed percentage of points you need in each ungraded category to get a specific grade in a class.  Remember to try your best in each class and not solely use just this calculated value (or best and worst possible grades) to determine how well you will do in a course.

This program saved and updates your grades on the spot when a new grade is entered onto the grades table. As long as there are no empty cells in the table and everything is valid, the program will compute your updated grades and save it automatically (and use it for the quicklaunch utility). When switching classes and categories, the program will autosave before the switch occurs (if able to) since it can be easy to forget that you did not save your newly added grades.

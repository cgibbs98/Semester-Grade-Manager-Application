The program also has functionality to modify the semester directory if needed. You will be able to rename a semester folder, copy an existing folder with a new name, and delete existing folders. You can also open up the semester directory if you need to view files from there. Any change you make to any semester folder or subfiles are not backed up in any way so don't modify or delete anything unless you need to.

# Semester-Grade-Manager-Application
   A Java Application that allows users to view and edit grades for each class during a college semester freely. This program will allow you to create a semester with classes and categories with different grading scales and select what class and category you want to view at any one time. You will also be able to view overall class grades (or best and worst possible grades if not all categories have a set grade saved) along with basic stats to help calculate grades and find out what percentage of points you need in any ungraded category remaining to obtain a specific grade in a class. This application was developed using Eclipse IDE.

This program is currently not finished, new features are currently being implemented.

NOTE: Edit txt files for class and launch files AT YOUR OWN RISK! Unintended consequences can (and likely will) occur if a file is modifed from its orignal format or if invalid values are used in place of saved data. Implementation to safely edit files within the application may be added in a future commit.
